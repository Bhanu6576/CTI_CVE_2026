  "description": "n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. Prior to versions 1.123.12 and 2.4.0, when workflows process uploaded files and transfer them to remote servers via the SSH node without validating their metadata the vulnerability can lead to files being written to unintended locations on those remote systems potentially leading to remote code execution on those systems. As a prerequisites an unauthenticated attacker needs knowledge of such workflows existing and the endpoints for file uploads need to be unauthenticated. This issue has been patched in versions 1.123.12 and 2.4.0.",
