  "description": "Gladinet CentreStack and Triofox prior to version 16.12.10420.56791 used hardcoded values for their implementation of the AES cryptoscheme. This degrades security for public exposed endpoints that may make use of it and may offer arbitrary local file inclusion when provided a specially crafted request without authentication. This opens the door for future exploitation and can be leveraged with previous vulnerabilities to gain a full system compromise.",
