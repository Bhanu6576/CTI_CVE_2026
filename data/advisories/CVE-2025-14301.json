  "description": "The Integration Opvius AI for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This is due to the `process_table_bulk_actions()` function processing user-supplied file paths without authentication checks, nonce verification, or path validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or download arbitrary files on the server via the `wsaw-log[]` POST parameter, which can be leveraged to delete critical files like `wp-config.php` or read sensitive configuration files.",
