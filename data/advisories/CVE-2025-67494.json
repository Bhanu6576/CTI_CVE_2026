  "description": "ZITADEL is an open-source identity infrastructure tool. Versions 4.7.0 and below are vulnerable to an unauthenticated, full-read SSRF vulnerability. The ZITADEL Login UI (V2) treats the x-zitadel-forward-host header as a trusted fallback for all deployments, including self-hosted instances.

This issue is fixed in version 4.7.1.",
