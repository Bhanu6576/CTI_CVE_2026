  "description": "5ire is a cross-platform desktop artificial intelligence assistant and model context protocol client. Prior to version 0.15.3, an unsafe option parsing vulnerability in the ECharts Markdown plugin allows any user able to submit ECharts code blocks to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the renderer context.
