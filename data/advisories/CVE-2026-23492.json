  "description": "Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. Prior to 12.3.1 and 11.5.14, an incomplete SQL injection patch in the Admin Search Find API allows an authenticated attacker to perform blind SQL injection. Although CVE-2023-30848 attempted to mitigate SQL injection by removing SQL comments (--) and catching syntax errors, the fix is insufficient. Attackers can still inject SQL payloads that do not rely on comments and infer database information via blind techniques. This vulnerability affects the admin interface and can lead to database information disclosure. This vulnerability is fixed in 12.3.1 and 11.5.14.",
