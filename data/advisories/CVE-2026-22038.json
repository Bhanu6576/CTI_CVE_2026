  "description": "AutoGPT is a platform that allows users to create, deploy, and manage continuous artificial intelligence agents that automate complex workflows. Prior to autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46, the AutoGPT platform's Stagehand integration blocks log API keys and authentication secrets in plaintext using logger.info() statements. This occurs in three separate block implementations (StagehandObserveBlock, StagehandActBlock, and StagehandExtractBlock) where the code explicitly calls api_key.get_secret_value() and logs the result. This issue has been patched in autogpt-platform-beta-v0.6.46.",
