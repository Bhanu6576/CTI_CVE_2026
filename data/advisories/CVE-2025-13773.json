  "description": "The Print Invoice & Delivery Notes for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution in all versions up to, and including, 5.8.0 via the 'WooCommerce_Delivery_Notes::update' function. This is due to missing capability check in the 'WooCommerce_Delivery_Notes::update' function, PHP enabled in Dompdf, and missing escape in the 'template.php' file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute code on the server.",
