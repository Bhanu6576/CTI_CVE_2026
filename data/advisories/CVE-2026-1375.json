  "description": "The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) in all versions up to, and including, 3.9.5. This is due to missing object-level authorization checks in the `course_list_bulk_action()`, `bulk_delete_course()`, and `update_course_status()` functions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Tutor Instructor-level access and above, to modify or delete arbitrary courses they do not own by manipulating course IDs in bulk action requests.",
