  "description": "A Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in the /reporting/templates/preview/ endpoint of Amidaware Tactical RMM, affecting versions equal to or earlier than v1.3.1, allows low-privileged users with Report Viewer or Report Manager permissions to achieve remote command execution on the server. This occurs due to improper sanitization of the template_md parameter, enabling direct injection of Jinja2 templates. This occurs due to misuse of the generate_html() function, the user-controlled value is inserted into `env.from_string`, a function that processes Jinja2 templates arbitrarily, making an SSTI possible.",
