  "description": "The Thermo Fisher Torrent Suite Django application 5.18.1 has weak default credentials, which are stored as fixtures for the Django ORM API. The ionadmin user account can be used to authenticate to default deployments with the password ionadmin.

Many deployments may retain default credentials, in which case an attacker is likely to be able to successfully authenticate with administrative privileges.",
