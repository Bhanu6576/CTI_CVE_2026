  "description": "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Circutor SGE-PLC1000/SGE-PLC50 v9.0.2. In the 'ShowSupervisorParameters()' function, there is an unlimited user input that is copied to a fixed-size buffer via 'sprintf()'. The 'GetParameter(meter)' function retrieves the user input, which is directly incorporated into a buffer without size validation. An attacker can provide an excessively large input for the 'meter' parameter.",
