  "description": "Wildfire IM is an instant messaging and real-time audio/video solution. Prior to 1.4.3, a critical vulnerability exists in the im-server component related to the file upload functionality found in com.xiaoleilu.loServer.action.UploadFileAction. The application exposes an endpoint (/fs) that handles multipart file uploads but fails to properly sanitize the filename provided by the user. Specifically, the writeFileUploadData method directly concatenates the configured storage directory with the filename extracted from the upload request without stripping directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../). This vulnerability allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to any location on the server's filesystem where the application process has write permissions. By uploading malicious files (such as scripts, executables, or overwriting configuration files like authorized_keys or cron jobs), an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and completely compromise the server. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.3.",
