  "description": "The Fox LMS – WordPress LMS Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.5.1. This is due to the plugin not properly validating the 'role' parameter when creating new users via the `/fox-lms/v1/payments/create-order` REST API endpoint. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new user accounts with arbitrary roles, including administrator, leading to complete site compromise.",
